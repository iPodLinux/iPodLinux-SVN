    This is an About box, much like the one in the Apple firmware. Please
    enable it, as it contains version information that will be very useful
    to us if you have a problem.

config ABOUT_SHOW_SN
  bool "Show serial number in About box"
  depends on MODULE_about
  default y
  ---help---
    If you're uncomfortable having your iPod's serial number plainly visible
    in the About box, feel free to say `n' here and it won't show up. (I don't
    know *why* you'd want this, but it's there if you're paranoid.)
